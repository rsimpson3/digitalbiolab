The Digital BioLab web application is a personalized learning solution for Hinton Scholars AP Biology students. It's optimized as a responsively designed site for mobile devices. A bit about me.

The Digital BioLab app is my capstone project for a masters in Digital Media Design from Harvard Extension School (Spring 2017).
