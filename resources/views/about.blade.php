        <p> The Digital BioLab prototype is designed to help Hinton Scholar students manage their learning of AP<sup>®</sup> Biology. The mobile app takes advantage of student owned mobile devices. The prototype consists of a tablet optimized dashboard app and a mobile app that connects students to their data, peers and instructors.

We explored changes to instructional practice with three key innovations 1) a <a href="http://hinton.harvardmedk12.wikispaces.net/">wiki environment</a> for sharing curriculum resources that increased communication between students and tutors and afforded rapid sharing of digitized laboratory data, 2) integration of digital probeware and instrumentation into four AP Biology lab sessions, 3) assessment of student understanding of major AP Biology themes and science practices using the nearpod application (app). Piloting these new innovations have helped create a 21st century science learning environment, provided practical insights on implementing <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards">Next Generation Science Standards </a>and assisted educators with new instructional strategies adapted for the AP Biology curriculum redesign.

        <p><img class="floatright" src="images/main/digital_biolab-1_320px.jpg" alt="Student responds to questions using their smart phone the lab.">Two of the biggest trends impacting the education of today’s students are the rapid growth of Social Media platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices. The intersection of these two trends has produced what Gardner and Davis describe as the <book>App Generation.</book> We are exploring how to adapt a face-to-face science instruction model to meet the needs of these <em>connected</em> learners. The Digital BioLab project will test the effect of using mobile technologies on student learning in an established AP Biology program at Harvard Medical School. Students and educators will use a custom built mobile app and website dashboard designed to enable student self-assessment of learning progress based on the AP Biology Big Ideas curriculum framework. Empowering students to track and reflect on their own learning has the potential to increase learner engagement, improve metacognition of scientific thinking and reinforce mastery of AP Biology practices. Project educators will have a new app-based formative assessment tool for implementing active learning environments that support science inquiry.

        <p> <img class="floatleft" src="images/main/tweets_ap_bio_blurred_500px.jpg" alt="3 student tweets on apbiology"> Social media provides insight into how today's students react and respond to rigorous science coursework. A sampling of student tweets captured in September 2013 illustrate a wide range of opinions. Over 70% of the tweets generated during one day were negative in nature. Performing a keyword search of social media channels such as Twitter using "apbiology" can be used as a formative assessment tool. The Digital BioLab app plans to incorporate these alternate, student-driven forms of response.
