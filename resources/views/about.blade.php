            <p> The Digital BioLab web application was designed to help Hinton Scholar students manage their learning of AP<sup>®</sup> Biology. This mobile-friendly app takes advantage of student owned mobile devices. The design consists of a tablet optimized dashboard and a responsively enabled mobile version that connects students to their data, peers and instructors.

We explored changes to instructional practice with three key innovations in mind: 1) a <a href="http://hinton.harvardmedk12.wikispaces.net/">wiki environment</a> for sharing curriculum resources that increased communication between students and tutors and afforded rapid sharing of digitized laboratory data, 2) integration of digital probeware and instrumentation into hands-on AP Biology lab sessions hosted at Harvard Medical School, and 3) assessment of student understanding of major AP Biology themes and science practices using a combination of low-tech and high tech assessment tools. Lab teams used low-tech Post-it notes to design and share their own open inquiry investigations. High-tech tools such as the Nearpod app helped lab instructors track understanding of important experimental steps and key biological concepts. Piloting these new innovations created a 21st century science learning environment, provided practical insights on implementing <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards">Next Generation Science Standards </a>and assisted educators with new instructional strategies adapted for the AP Biology curriculum.

The intersection of these two trends has produced what Gardner and Davis describe as the <a href="http://appgen.yupnet.org/"><book>App Generation.</book></a> We are exploring how to adapt a face-to-face science instruction model to meet the needs of these <em>connected</em> learners. The Digital BioLab project is researching the effect of using mobile technologies on student learning in an established AP Biology program at Harvard Medical School. Students and educators can use this customized mobile app and dashboard to enable student self-assessment of learning progress based on the AP Biology Big Ideas framework. This beta version contains four key modules: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Big Ideas Understanding</li>
                    <li>Wheel of Vernier Game App</li>
                    <li>Lab Data Viewer</li>
                    <li>Scientific Inquiry adapted Question Formulation Technique (QFT)</li>
                </ol> 
            Empowering students to track and reflect on their own learning has the potential to increase learner engagement, improve metacognition of scientific thinking and reinforce mastery of AP Biology practices. Project educators will have a new app-based formative assessment tool for implementing active learning environments that support science inquiry.

A sampling of student tweets captured in September 2013 illustrate a wide range of opinions. Over 70% of the tweets generated during one day were negative in nature. Performing a keyword search of social media channels such as Twitter using "apbiology" can be used as a formative assessment tool. The Digital BioLab app plans to incorporate these alternate, student-driven forms of response.
